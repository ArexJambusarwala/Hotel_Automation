Description: # Device Controller
        
        This is a REST API server for Raspberry PI microcontroller which provides simple interface to control devices attached to the microcontroller.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        You will need `python 3.x` installed
        
        ### Installing
        
        After cloning/downloading this repository you can install device-controller python package using following commands.
        
        ```console
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Running
        
        If you have path variables setup correctly, you can run this API server by `controller` command. If you want to run it as daemon then use `controller &` command.
        
        ## Deployment
        
        These instructions will help you deploy this API server to actual Raspberry Pi. You need to install `gpiozero` package which provides utility to control GPIO pins of the board.
        
        First, update your repositories list:
        ```console
        pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo apt update
        ```
        Then install the package for Python 3:
        ```console
        pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo apt install python3-gpiozero
        ```
        
        Now, you can install device-controller as stated above. You can also run this program at startup automatically using `crontab` utility.
